### Why Goal-Setting Matters 🎯

Setting goals helps you stay focused, track progress, and improve time management. But too often, we set vague goals without a clear plan.

### How TaskFlow Helps ✅

TaskFlow simplifies goal-setting by:

- **Breaking goals into smaller tasks** 📝
- **Setting daily, weekly, and long-term targets** 📆
- **Sending reminders to keep you on track** ⏰

### Example: Turning Big Goals into Actionable Steps

❌ *"I want to get better grades this semester."*
✅ *"I will study 2 hours daily, review notes weekly, and complete all assignments on time."*

With TaskFlow, your goals stay structured and achievable. Start today! 🚀
